The fopen function opens the file that is specified by filename. By default, a narrow filename string is interpreted using the ANSI codepage (CP_ACP). In Windows Desktop applications this can be changed to the OEM codepage (CP_OEMCP) by using the SetFileApisToOEM function. You can use the AreFileApisANSI function to determine whether filename is interpreted using the ANSI or the system default OEM codepage. _wfopen is a wide-character version of fopen; the arguments to _wfopen are wide-character strings. Otherwise, _wfopen and fopen behave identically. Just using _wfopen does not affect the coded character set that is used in the file stream.
